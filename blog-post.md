## AI in Action

> AI is transforming how we approach healthcare, making it more efficient and effective.

Consider the case of predictive analytics in healthcare. By analyzing vast amounts of patient data, AI can predict disease outbreaks, allowing for timely interventions.

\`Here is a code snippet example:\`

\`\`\`python
import numpy as np

# Simple example of AI in predictive analytics
def predict_outcome(patient_data):
    # Placeholder for complex AI model
    return np.mean(patient_data)

patient_data = [70, 75, 80, 85, 90]
print(f"Predicted outcome: {predict_outcome(patient_data)}")
\`\`\`

AI's potential in healthcare is vast, and we are just scratching the surface. As technology advances, we can expect even more innovative solutions to emerge, improving healthcare for all.
